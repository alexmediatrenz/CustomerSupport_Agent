# CustomerSupport_Agent
This repo contains customer support agent for Mediatrenz a digital marketing agency. 
To build a customer support agent for Mediatrenz, a digital marketing company, using the Agno framework as outlined in the documentation at https://docs.agno.com/agents/introduction, follow these detailed steps. The Agno framework is a lightweight, model-agnostic library designed for creating multi-modal agents, making it suitable for this task. Below is a comprehensive guide to setting up the agent, configuring its behavior, and deploying it effectively.
Step 1: Understand the Requirements
A customer support agent for Mediatrenz needs to:
Answer common queries about services (e.g., SEO, PPC, social media management).
Provide contact information for human support.
Handle basic troubleshooting or escalate complex issues to a human agent.
Maintain a professional yet friendly tone, ensuring responses are clear and concise.
Ensure accuracy by leveraging a knowledge base with up-to-date information.
Step 2: Set Up the Development Environment
Install Agno and Dependencies:
Agno is a Python-based framework. Install it along with required dependencies using pip:
bash
pip install agno openai
Set Up API Keys:
Since Agno is model-agnostic, you'll need to choose a language model (e.g., OpenAI's GPT-4) and set up API keys. Add the keys to your environment:
bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxxx
Step 3: Choose a Language Model
For customer support, select a model strong in natural language understanding and generation, such as OpenAI's GPT-4. This ensures the agent can handle diverse queries effectively.
Step 4: Configure the Agent
Initialize the Agent:
Use the Agent class from Agno to create the customer support agent.
Provide a description to define the agent's role.
Set Up a Knowledge Base:
Agno supports knowledge stores for efficient information retrieval (e.g., vector databases like LanceDb for Agentic RAG).
Populate the knowledge base with FAQs, service descriptions, and contact details.
Enable Memory Management:
Enable memory to maintain context across multiple interactions, which is crucial for follow-up questions.
Step 5: Define the Knowledge Base
Create the Knowledge Base Content:
Prepare structured question-answer pairs or documents covering common customer queries. Example:
Q: What services does Mediatrenz offer?
A: Mediatrenz offers SEO, PPC advertising, social media management, content marketing, and email marketing.
Q: How can I contact customer support?
A: You can contact our customer support team via email at support@mediatrenz.com or by phone at 1-800-123-4567.
Store this information in a text file (e.g., faqs.txt) or a vector database, depending on the implementation.
Load the Knowledge Base:
Use Agno's knowledge base tools to load the information. For a text file, you might use a class like TextFileKnowledgeBase (refer to the Agno documentation for specifics).
Step 6: Implement Escalation Logic
Define Escalation Rules:
Set up rules for when the agent should escalate queries to a human agent. This could be based on:
Keywords (e.g., "urgent," "problem").
Missing information in the knowledge base.
Example response for escalation:
"I'm sorry, I don't have that information. Would you like to speak to a human agent?"
Confidence Threshold:
If the agent's confidence in its response is low, it can offer to connect the customer with a human agent.
Step 7: Test the Agent
Prepare Test Queries:
Create a set of test questions to verify accuracy and helpfulness. Include common and edge-case queries:
Common Query:
Q: What services do you offer?
Expected A: Mediatrenz offers SEO, PPC advertising, social media management, content marketing, and email marketing.
Edge Case:
Q: Tell me a joke.
Expected A: I'm here to help with questions about Mediatrenz's services. If you have a specific question, feel free to ask!
Iterate and Refine:
Based on test results, update the knowledge base or adjust the agent's configuration to improve performance.
Step 8: Deploy the Agent
Integration:
Depending on the deployment environment (e.g., website chatbot, messaging platform), integrate the agent:
Agno may provide deployment tools (refer to documentation).
Alternatively, create a web API using frameworks like Flask or FastAPI. Example:
python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/chat', methods=['POST'])
def chat():
    user_input = request.json['message']
    response = agent.respond(user_input)
    return jsonify({'response': response})
The website can send POST requests to this endpoint and display the agent's response.
Monitoring:
Utilize Agno's monitoring capabilities to track performance and identify areas for improvement.
Example Code Structure
Below is a rough outline of how the code might look based on typical Agno usage (refer to documentation for exact implementation):
python
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat
from agno.knowledge.text_file import TextFileKnowledgeBase  # Hypothetical class

# Initialize knowledge base with FAQs
knowledge_base = TextFileKnowledgeBase(file_path="faqs.txt")

# Create the agent
agent = Agent(
    model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-4o"),
    description="You are a friendly and helpful customer support agent for Mediatrenz, a digital marketing company.",
    knowledge=knowledge_base,
    memory=True,  # Enable memory for context management
    markdown=True  # Enable markdown for formatted responses
)

# Load the knowledge base
agent.knowledge.load()

# Respond to a query
agent.print_response("What services does Mediatrenz offer?", stream=True)
Step 9: Ensure Security and Privacy
Data Handling:
Ensure the agent respects user privacy and does not store or misuse sensitive information.
Secure Deployment:
If deploying as a web service, implement authentication and secure communication protocols.
Step 10: Maintain and Update
Regular Updates:
Keep the knowledge base up-to-date with the latest company information.
Feedback Loop:
Use customer feedback and monitoring data to continuously improve the agent's performance.
Conclusion
By following these steps and leveraging the Agno framework as per the documentation, you can create an effective customer support agent for Mediatrenz. The agent will:
Handle common customer queries using a knowledge base.
Escalate complex issues to a human agent when necessary.
Enhance customer experience while reducing the workload on human agents.
With proper testing, deployment, and maintenance, this agent can significantly improve Mediatrenz's customer support capabilities. Note that actual implementation details may vary based on the specific features of the Agno framework, which you should reference from the documentation at https://docs.agno.com/agents/introduction.
