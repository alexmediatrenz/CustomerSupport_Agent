Enhancelements to Consider
After building this initial version, consider these improvements:
Vector Database: Replace TextFileKnowledgeBase with LanceDbKnowledgeBase, using embeddings (e.g., OpenAI’s text-embedding-ada-002) for semantic search.
Dynamic Responses: Use GPT-4 to generate natural responses when the knowledge base lacks a direct answer, rather than immediately escalating.
Session Management: Ensure memory isolation for multiple users (Agno might handle this; verify documentation).
Logging: Add logging to track interactions and debug issues.
Security: Implement API authentication and rate limiting for production use.
Conclusion
This implementation provides a functional customer support agent for Mediatrenz using the Agno framework. The components include:
A text-based knowledge base (faqs.txt) with essential information.
A custom knowledge base class (knowledge_base.py) for loading and searching FAQs.
An agent configuration (agent_config.py) with escalation logic and memory support.
A Flask deployment (app.py) for web access.
By running python app.py, you can deploy the agent locally and extend it further based on real-world feedback or specific Agno documentation. This setup balances simplicity with functionality, making it a solid starting point for Mediatrenz’s customer support needs.
