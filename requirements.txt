To run this project, we need the following dependencies. Since Agno is hypothetical, I’ll include typical packages that align with the assumed functionality.
requirements.txt

< flask==3.0.0
# Hypothetical Agno framework (replace with actual package if available)
# agno==x.x.x
# OpenAI API for GPT-4 (assuming Agno integrates with it)
openai==1.10.0>

Install these 
pip install -r requirements.txt

Note: In reality, you’d need the exact Agno package and possibly additional dependencies (e.g., lancedb for a vector database).

Run the Flask app (python app.py) and use a tool like curl or Postman to test:
bash

curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"conversation_id": "test1", "message": "What services does Mediatrenz offer?"}' http://localhost:5000/chat
